# Accelerate [Retro.bio](https://retro.bio/)

Accelerating [Longevity Biotech](https://www.longbiofellowship.org/), using Cerebras, OpenRouter, Qwen3 32B.

Intention: to build something to accelerate some AI workflow Retro or other longevity biotech companies would find extremely useful or interesting (agents or DNA/other models).

Result: too late to this hackathon. Preparing for the next one already :)

Thank you for organizing!
